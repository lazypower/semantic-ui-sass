#Semantic-UI-Sass

This is a direct rip of the files from [doabit's Rails Project](https://github.com/doabit/semantic-ui-sass). I wanted Semantic UI in Sass form for inclusion in a [yeoman](http://yeoman.io) Project.

Thus this repository was born.


### Todo

Script the fetch, parse, and replacing of any modified content
Make it useful for the Yeoman generators
Document how to get it to build in the Grunt framework
